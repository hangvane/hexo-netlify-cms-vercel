# Usage

1. Click `Use this template` to fork this repository. It can be private.

1. Modify `/source/admin/config.yml`. Change the value of `backend.repo` and `backend.base_url` to yours.

1. Go to [Github Developer applications](https://github.com/settings/developers) and create a new oauth app. The only important field is `Authorization callback URL`, input `https://<domain>/callback`, where `<domain>` is domain from step 2, also note that HTTPS is required. And then generate a new client secret.

1. Go to [**Vercel**](https://vercel.com/new) to import your repository and create a new project. Before clicking `Deploy` button, add the Environment Variables **`OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`** and **`OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`** and set the values as generated in the previous step.

1. Click `Deploy` button and waiting for the deployment finished.

1. Maybe you need to change the **Vercel** provided domain in *Settings > Domains*.

1. Open **`https://<domain>/admin/`** and login to the **Netlify-CMS** back-end.

1. Test whether **Netlify-CMS** is working properly.

1. If you need the preview feature provided by **Netlify-CMS**, that is, provides you a preview link on the article writing page once you click `save` button, you also need to link your blog repository to [**Netlify**](https://app.netlify.com/start). This is similar to link to **Vercel**, but you do not need to add Environment Variables since you do not use **Netlify-CMS** on the **Netlify** provided domain.

1. Congratulations! You have successfully deployed a **Hexo** blog with **Netlify-CMS** on **Vercel**.
